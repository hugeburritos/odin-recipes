    <p>Macaroni and cheese—also called mac 'n' cheese in the US and Canadian English, macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom—is a dish of English origin, consisting of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar.

        <li>In a large pot of boiling, salted water cook the pasta to al dente.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, in a separate pot, melt the butter. Whisk in the flour and mustard and keep it moving for about five minutes. Make sure it's free of lumps.</li>
