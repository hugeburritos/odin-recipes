    <h2>Banana Bread Description</h2>
    <p>Banana bread is a type of bread made from mashed bananas. It is often a moist, sweet, cake-like quick bread; however, there are some banana bread recipes that are traditional-style raised breads.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 very ripe bananas, peeled</li>
        <li>1/3 cup melted butter</li>

        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

    </ul>
