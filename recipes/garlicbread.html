    <h2>Garlic Bread Description</h2>
    <p>Garlic bread consists of bread, topped with garlic and olive oil or butter and may include additional herbs, such as chives. It is then either grilled or broiled until toasted or baked in an oven. It is typically made using a French baguette, or sometimes a sourdough like ciabatta which is partially sliced downwards, allowing the condiments to soak into the loaf while keeping it in one piece. The bread is then stuffed through the cuts with oil and minced garlic before baking.</p>
